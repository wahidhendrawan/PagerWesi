# Changelog

## 0.8.0 - 2026-06-18

- Added a reusable JSON Schema for machine-readable findings (`docs/finding.schema.json`).
- Added regression coverage to validate rendered JSON findings against the schema.
- Added `--watch-providers` for agent mode and preserved agent exit codes in the CLI.
- Changed agent provider failures to emit `AGENT-PROVIDER-001` error findings instead of being
  silently ignored.
- Fixed webhook, dashboard, and compliance exports to handle both `Finding` objects and serialized
  finding dictionaries consistently.
- Completed control metadata coverage for Docker, secrets, Terraform plan, and network/TLS
  scanners.
- Clarified that `pagerwesi all` runs the core cloud provider set only: AWS, Azure, GCP,
  and Kubernetes.
- Pinned the LocalStack integration image to avoid upstream `latest` license-token drift.
- Added community health files and updated project licensing metadata to GPL-3.0-or-later.
- Updated README, Quickstart, and GitHub Pages documentation for local scanners, finding schema,
  compliance evidence, dashboard generation, and agent mode.
